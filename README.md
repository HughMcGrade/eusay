eusay
=====
EUSA wants to know what students think and students want to share their ideas - eusay provides the solution.


To do:
------
* Tidy up all code **a lot**
* Set up EASE authentication ([1][ease1]) ([2][ease2])
* Markdown comments would be cool ([1][django_markdown])
* Set up Google Analytics
* Add features for representatives and candidates


Questions
------------
* Will EASE give us a name or only a matric number? If no name, how should we identify users on the site?
* Should anonymous proposals be accepted?

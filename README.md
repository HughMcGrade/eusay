eusay
=====
eusa wants to know what students think. students want to share their proposals. eusay provides the solution.


To do:
------
* Actually write some code
* Make templates
* Set up EASE authentication ([1][ease1]) ([2][ease2])
* Set up Google Analytics


Questions
------------
* Will EASE give us a name or only a matrix number? If no name, how should we identify users on the site?
* Should anonymous proposals be accepted?

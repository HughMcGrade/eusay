eusay
=====
eusay is a voting and discussion platform where students can submit proposals to the student union and vote/comment on each other's ideas. Students get a platform, and the student union gets information on what the students want. Everyone wins.

eusay was born during the Smart Data Hack in the 2014 Innovative Learning Week at the University of Edinburgh.

eusay is funded by the [Jisc Summer of Student Innovation](http://elevator.jisc.ac.uk/sosi14/) competition.

See requirements.txt for package requirements.
